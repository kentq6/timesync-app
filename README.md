# timesync-app
TimeSync is a simple and efficient calendar app with Google Calendar integration that helps you manage your events, meetings, and schedules. The goal of this project is to practice full-stack development, allowing myself to practice tech like TypeScript and Next.js while also allowing room for new tech such as Neon, Drizzle, and Clerk.
